--files were too large to be combined into one table. Instead, I combined two months into each table and performed analysis on each one with the following queries

--create new table
CREATE TABLE 2020607_tripdata
(
ride_id VARCHAR(255),
rideable_type VARCHAR(255),
started_at DATETIME,
ended_at DATETIME,
ride_length TIME,
day_of_week VARCHAR(255),
name_of_day VARCHAR(255),
start_station_name VARCHAR(255),
start_station_id VARCHAR(255),
end_station_name VARCHAR (255),
end_station_id VARCHAR(255),
member_casual VARCHAR(255)
);

-- LOAD DATA INFILE
LOAD DATA INFILE '20200607_tripdata.csv' INTO TABLE 20200607_tripdata
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
IGNORE 1 LINES;

-- CREATE new column
ALTER TABLE 2020_0607_tripdata
ADD ride_duration int

-- UPDATE new column with time difference calculation
UPDATE 2020_0607_tripdata
SET ride_duration = timestampdiff(minute, started_at, end_at)
  
-- MAX, MIN, MEAN for member rides

SELECT MAX(ride_duration)
FROM 2020_0607_tripdata

SELECT MIN(ride_duration)

WHERE member_casual LIKE 'm%'

SELECT avg(ride_duration)
FROM 2020_0607_tripdata

  -- MAX, MIN, MEAN for casual rides

SELECT MAX(ride_duration)
